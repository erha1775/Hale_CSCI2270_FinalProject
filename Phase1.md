# Hale_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Final project for CU boulder data structures summer 2017

For my final project I want to make a travel agent program using a graph of different vacation destinations each having a pointer to an array of different attractions and a linked list of different hotel options. The graph will start at the denver airport and will go to other major airports to get to the destinations.  The user can use a menu driven function to search the different travel options or they can search for a travel destination based on the attractions they are looking for (beaches, good restaurants, etc.) or how far they want to travel (assuming they start in Boulder).  Once they choose a location they can search for a hotel based on how many people are staying, how expensive of a room they want, or the hotel's rating.  This function will create a temporary linked list sorted based on the user's preference and will then allow them to choose which hotel they would like from that list.
